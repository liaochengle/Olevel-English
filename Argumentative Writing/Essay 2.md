People should always tell the truth.’ Do you think there are any situations in which this might not be the best thing to do? Explain your views. (2017)
 
“In law a man is guilty when he violates the rights of others. In ethics he is guilty if he only thinks of doing so.” This quote from Immanuel Kant highlights his unwavering stance on the moral imperative of truth-telling. Aligned with Kant’s categorial imperative, I firmly believe that people should always tell the truth, without exception. In my perspective, lying cannot be justified by any potential benefits or seemingly benevolent intentions.

Telling the truth, even in difficult circumstances, safeguards human dignity, nurtures trust and reinforces the very foundations upon which ethical communities stand. Consequently, one might wonder whether there are any situations—perhaps those involving safety, privacy, or compassion—where withholding or bending the truth might be permissible. Despite these questions, the Kantian principle remains unyielding: it is our duty to respect truthfulness as a moral law, no matter the circumstances.

First and foremost, being absolutely honest is paramount for a fulfilling life. Telling the truth, even in difficult circumstances, safeguards human dignity and nurtures trust. When one is perceived as a person of integrity, others are more inclined to place their trust in them and forge enduring relationships, ultimately contributing to a resilient social network that benefits everyone. In addition, telling the truth will reduce your moral burden. By being truthful and sincere in daily interactions with others, individuals free themselves from anxiety and guilt. Therefore, being completely honest fosters deeper connections and a healthier perception of oneself, facilitating happiness in life.
 
The opposing views claim that we can make exceptions for general rule, which is being honest, against lying with the white lie, a lie that we think of as justified by the consequences, such as avoiding hurting people’s feelings. In this scenario, lying might initially appear to do more good than harm by sparing someone’s feelings. While this view seems plausible at first, it neglects the potential fallout that deceit can bring. If the person you lied to—ostensibly to protect them—later discovers the truth, they are likely to feel even more betrayed and hurt than if you had been honest from the start. Not only must they contend with the underlying issue itself, but they must also grapple with the fact that someone they trusted has deceived them.

People should always tell the truth.’ Do you think there are any situations in which this might not be the best thing to do? Explain your views. (2017)
 
“In law a man is guilty when he violates the rights of others. In ethics he is guilty if he only thinks of doing so.” This quote from Immanuel Kant highlights his unwavering stance on the moral imperative of truth-telling. Aligned with Kant’s categorial imperative, I firmly believe that people should always tell the truth, without exception. In my perspective, lying cannot be justified by any potential benefits or seemingly benevolent intentions.

Telling the truth, even in difficult circumstances, safeguards human dignity, nurtures trust and reinforces the very foundations upon which ethical communities stand. Consequently, one might wonder whether there are any situations—perhaps those involving safety, privacy, or compassion—where withholding or bending the truth might be permissible. Despite these questions, the Kantian principle remains unyielding: it is our duty to respect truthfulness as a moral law, no matter the circumstances.

First and foremost, being absolutely honest is paramount for a fulfilling life. Telling the truth, even in difficult circumstances, safeguards human dignity and nurtures trust. When one is perceived as a person of integrity, others are more inclined to place their trust in them and forge enduring relationships, ultimately contributing to a resilient social network that benefits everyone. In addition, telling the truth will reduce your moral burden. By being truthful and sincere in daily interactions with others, individuals free themselves from anxiety and guilt. Therefore, being completely honest fosters deeper connections and a healthier perception of oneself, facilitating happiness in life.
 
The opposing views claim that we can make exceptions for general rule, which is being honest, against lying with the white lie, a lie that we think of as justified by the consequences, such as avoiding hurting people’s feelings. In this scenario, lying might initially appear to do more good than harm by sparing someone’s feelings. While this view seems plausible at first, it neglects the potential fallout that deceit can bring. If the person you lied to—ostensibly to protect them—later discovers the truth, they are likely to feel even more betrayed and hurt than if you had been honest from the start. Not only must they contend with the underlying issue itself, but they must also grapple with the fact that someone they trusted has deceived them.

Secondly, telling the truth plays a paramount role in achieving professional success. By demonstrating unwavering integrity in the workplace, individuals cultivate a reputation for reliability and trustworthiness. For instance, your colleagues or clients will be far more disposed to cooperate and engage in endeavors business with you if they have faith in you and can rely on the sincerity of your statements. This will ultimately lead to more work opportunities and better collaboration, thereby significantly increasing the likelihood of career advancement.

Some critics may argue that, in some extreme circumstances, lying is the only possible resolution. What if a murderer came to your door, looking for your friend who was hiding in your house? In that life-threatening situation, it is impossible to avoid telling a lie without selling out your friend. However, what is argument overlooks is that instead of telling a lie and harming our own integrity, we can choose a deceiving and misleading truth. For example, “I don’t know where he is.”, because he could be in the closet, yet he could not be, and since you are not checking the closet at that very moment, this statement remains strictly true.

In essence, my stand remains unyielding, it is our duty to respect truthfulness as a moral law, no matter the circumstances. Being completely honest will not only be benevolent to your character building, fostering a sense of happiness in life, but also instrumentally assist you on your way to achieve professional success.

“Having more can make a person happier” Do you agree?

Are people becoming more and more materialistic? Does having more make people happier? These controversial questions are hotly debated in the 21st century. The increasing prevalence of materialism has been unprecedented due to growing competitiveness and craving among people. However, I firmly posit that having more cannot ultimately make a person happier.

First and foremost, possessing more things won’t lead to ultimate happiness and fulfilment in life because of human’s unsatiable pursuit of material possessions. The word “more” conveys that there is no upper limit of people’s desires, as they constantly yearn for additional wealth, status, or belongings. For instance, I had been yearning for an iPad, but after I finally had one, the excitement didn’t last as long as I anticipated. I soon realized that a MacBook would be more helpful for my study, and I started longing for a MacBook instead. Therefore, as people’s desires are never completely satisfied by having more possessions, this endless cycle of wanting more hinders them from experiencing lasting happiness.

Yet, some have propounded that having more leads to a higher standard of living. They argue that acquiring wealth can provide access to better resources, such as improved healthcare and quality education, ultimately contributing to a more comfortable life. This view may seem convincing at first, but what it overlooks is that the sense of satisfaction created by the possession of goods or wealth is only temporary. Indeed, the momentary contentment brought by material gains will soon be replaced by people’s ambition to acquire more. As elucidated in the previous paragraph, the nature of greed will inhibit people on their way to finding true happiness.

Secondly, having more could potentially lead to an aimless life, fostering a sense of meaningless. This is because the endless pursuit of material possessions will shift your focus away from meaningful goals, such as personal growth and relationships. For example, people who amass great wealth may feel a temporary sense of achievement, but without deeper aspirations or goals, they will soon face a lack of direction and purpose. On the other side, people who derive their sense of purpose from intrinsic goals, such as self-improvement, tend to achieve higher levels of life satisfaction. Hence, when people prioritize acquiring wealth or possessions over other aspects of life, they may constantly feel lost and unfulfilled.

In essence, due to the inherent nature of greed and lack of focus on meaningful and intrinsic personal goals, the accumulation of possessions alone cannot lead to a truly fulfilling life. Instead, true happiness and fulfilment come from cultivating connections with others, pursuing personal growth and contributing to society. By shifting attention from material pursuits to intrinsic values, people can break the cycle of endless desire and achieve a life of greater meaning.

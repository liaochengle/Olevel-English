“Having more can make a person happier” Do you agree?

Are people becoming more and more materialistic? Does having more make people happier? These controversial questions are hotly debated in the 21st century. The increasing prevalence of materialism has been unprecedented due to growing competitiveness and craving among people. However, I firmly posit that having more cannot ultimately make a person happier.

First and foremost, possessing more things won’t lead to ultimate happiness and fulfilment in life because of human’s unsatiable pursuit of material possessions. The word “more” conveys that there is no upper limit of people’s desires, as they constantly yearn for additional wealth, status, or belongings. For instance, I had been yearning for an iPad, but after I finally had one, the excitement didn’t last as long as I anticipated. I soon realized that a MacBook would be more helpful for my study, and I started longing for a MacBook instead. Therefore, as people’s desires are never completely satisfied by having more possessions, this endless cycle of wanting more hinders them from experiencing lasting happiness.

Yet, some have propounded that having more leads to a higher standard of living. They argue that acquiring wealth can provide access to better resources, such as improved healthcare and quality education, ultimately contributing to a more comfortable life. This view may seem convincing at first, but what it overlooks is that the sense of satisfaction created by the possession of goods or wealth is only temporary. Indeed, the momentary contentment brought by material gains will soon be replaced by people’s ambition to acquire more. As elucidated in the previous paragraph, the nature of greed will inhibit people on their way to finding true happiness.

Do you think that your generation is at a disadvantage compared to your parents’ generation? Why or why not?

Can you imagine life 30 years ago, without iPhones, MacBooks, or Nintendo Switches? That was the reality of our parents’ childhood. With rapid innovations and technological advancements, the world has undergone a dramatic transformation, creating a stark contrast between our generation and theirs. While some may argue that life has become increasingly challenging, I firmly believe that our generation enjoys significant advantages over our parents’ generation.

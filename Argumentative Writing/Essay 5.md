Do you think that your generation is at a disadvantage compared to your parents’ generation? Why or why not?

Can you imagine life 30 years ago, without iPhones, MacBooks, or Nintendo Switches? That was the reality of our parents’ childhood. With rapid innovations and technological advancements, the world has undergone a dramatic transformation, creating a stark contrast between our generation and theirs. While some may argue that life has become increasingly challenging, I firmly believe that our generation enjoys significant advantages over our parents’ generation.

First and foremost, our generation has significantly benefited from the advent of electronic devices and the internet. This digital era guarantees vast and immediate access to infinite knowledge and global resources, increasing the level of convenience in our daily lives. For instance, in the past when my mother was trying to cook a new dish, she had to search through multiple books to find the right recipe. If she encountered any difficulties during the process, there was nothing she could do other than solve them on her own. In contrast, if I want to cook a meal today, I only need to click on the screen and search for the recipe I want and can instantly find solutions to any problems I encounter. Hence, easy access to a wealth of information has largely improved daily convenience, making life easier and more fulfilling.

Some critics may argue that the excessive information in the digital age can overwhelm the modern generation. Misleading content and unreliable sources are prevalent in the digital world, potentially impacting the younger generation negatively. For instance, believing inaccurate information regarding national policy can fuel hatred and discontent among youths, potentially leading to radical behaviours such as violence. However, this argument fails to acknowledge that the broad access to information will facilitate the development of critical thinking and analytical skills in youths. By learning to evaluate and discern credible sources, they will be able to make more informed and judicious decisions.
